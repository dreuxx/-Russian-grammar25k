## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

* Search existing issues firstâ€”your problem may already be reported or solved.
* Open a new issue with **clear steps to reproduce**, the expected behavior, and screenshots/logs if relevant.

### Feature Requests

* Explain **why** the feature is useful.
* Outline a minimal implementation plan if you have one.

### Adding New Data

We love fresh sentence pairs! Please follow these rules:

| Rule                                                 | Why                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Provide both **`incorrect`** and **`correct`** text. | Alignment is required for training. |
| Russian only; no mixed languages.                    | Keeps the corpus focused.           |
| Avoid personal data, slurs, or copyrighted material. | Legal & ethical compliance.         |
| Keep sentences â‰¤ 30 tokens when possible.            | Modelâ€‘friendly length.              |
| Use UTFâ€‘8 encoding and **no extra columns**.         | Consistency.                        |

**Workflow:**

1. Append your rows to `russian_gec_dataset.csv` *without altering existing lines*.
2. Run `make validate` to ensure:

   * CSV is wellâ€‘formed.
   * No duplicate pairs (exact match).
   * Both columns are nonâ€‘empty and differ.
3. Commit with a message like:

   ```
   chore(data): add 250 learner sentences about travel
   ```

### Documentation Improvements

Typos, clarifications, or new examplesâ€”feel free to open a PR that edits `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or notebooks.

## Style Guide

* **Markdown** files: wrap lines at 120â€¯chars, use descriptive headers (h2, h3).
* **Commit messages**: follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
* **Python**: autoâ€‘formatted with **black**; linted with **ruff**.
